        <p class="Che-Guevara1">The legacy of Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara </br>
            (June 14, 1928 – October 9, 1967) is constantly</br>
         evolving in the collective imagination. As a symbol of counterculture </br>
         worldwide, Guevara is one of the most recognizable and </br>
         influential  revolutionary figures of the twentieth century.</br>
          However, during his life, and even more since his death,</br>
           Che has elicited controversy </br>
          and wildly divergent opinions on his personal character and actions.</br>
           He has been both revered and reviled, being characterized as  </br>
          everything from a heroic defender of the poor, to a cold-hearted executioner.</p>
          <p class="Che-Guevara2">
            Guevara's extensive written legacy includes intellectual writings</br> 
            on radical Marxist politics and social theory, military/guerrilla </br>
            warfare strategy and tactics, diplomatic memos, books, speeches,</br>
             magazine articles, letters, poetry and diaries, as well as official </br>
             documents preserved in Cuban government archives. Che's practical</br>
              and theoretical work had a profound political impact around the globe</br>
               during the second half of the 20th century, especially in the developing </br>
               world, where revolutionary organizing and anti-colonial struggles were</br>
                inspired by his thought and example.[1] As a consequence, his writings</br>
                s have been translated into hundreds of different languages.</p>
                <p class="Che-Guevara3">
                    In 1967, while pictures of Guevara's dead body were being</br> 
                    circulated and the circumstances of his death debated, his </br>
                    legend began to spread. Demonstrations in protest against his</br>
                     execution occurred throughout the world, and articles, tributes,</br>
                      songs and poems were written about his life and death.[2]</br>
                       Latin America specialists advising the U.S. State Department </br>
                       immediately recognized the significance in the demise of</br>
                        "the most glamorous and reportedly most successful revolutionary", </br>
                        noting that Guevara would be eulogized by communists and other leftists as</br>
                         a "model revolutionary who met a heroic death.

                </p>
                <p class="Che-Guevara4">
                    British politician George Galloway has remarked that "one of the greatest </br>
                    mistakes the US state ever made was to create those pictures of Che's corpse. </br>
                    Its Christ-like poise in death ensured that his appeal would reach way beyond</br>
                     the turbulent university campus and into the hearts of the faithful, flocking</br>
                      to the worldly, fiery sermons of the liberation theologists."[4] The Economist</br>
                       magazine has also pointed out how Che's post death photos resemble Andrea Mantegna's</br>
                        The Lamentation over the Dead Christ. Thus fixing Guevara as a modern saint, </br>
                        the man who risked his life twice in countries that were not his own before giving </br>
                        it in a third, and whose invocation of the "new man", driven by moral rather than</br>
                         material incentives, smacked of Saint Ignatius of Loyola more than Marx.[5]

                <p class="castro1">
                    Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz (/ˈkæstroʊ/;[1] American Spanish:</br>
                     [fiˈðel aleˈxandɾo ˈkastɾo ˈrus]; 13 August 1926 – 25 November 2016) </br>
                     was a Cuban revolutionary and politician who was the leader of Cuba</br>
                      from 1959 to 2008, serving as the prime minister of Cuba from</br>
                       1959 to 1976 and president from 1976 to 2008. Ideologically </br>
                       a Marxist–Leninist and Cuban nationalist, he also served as the</br>
                        first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011. </br>
                        Under his administration, Cuba became a one-party communist state; </br>
                        industry and business were nationalized, and socialist reforms</br> 
                        were implemented throughout society
                </p>
                <p class="castro2">
                    In 1947, Castro joined the Party of the Cuban People </br> 
                    (or Orthodox Party; Partido Ortodoxo), founded by veteran </br> 
                    politician Eduardo Chibás. A charismatic figure, Chibás </br> 
                    advocated social justice, honest government, and political freedom, </br> 
                    while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform. Though</br> 
                     Chibás came third in the 1948 general election, Castro remained</br> 
                      committed to working on his behalf.[18] Student violence escalated</br> 
                       after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers, and Castro</br> 
                    soon received a death threat urging him to leave the university. </br> 
                    However, he refused to do so and began to carry a gun and</br> 
                     surround himself with armed friends.`
                </p>
                <p class="castro3">
                    In April 1948, Castro travelled to Bogotá, Colombia, leading</br> 
                     a Cuban student group sponsored by President Juan Perón's</br>  
                     Argentine government. There, the assassination of popular </br> 
                     leftist leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala led to widespread rioting</br> 
                      and clashes between the governing Conservatives—backed by the </br> 
                      army—and leftist Liberals.[28] Castro joined the Liberal cause </br>
                       by stealing guns from a police station, but subsequent police</br> 
                        investigations concluded that he had not been involved in any killings.</br> 
                        [28] In April 1948, the Organization of American States was founded at </br> 
                        a summit in Bogotá, leading to protests, which Castro joined.[29]
                </p>
                <p class="castro4">
                    Castro co-founded a legal partnership that primarily catered to poor </br>
                    Cubans, although it proved a financial failure.[41] Caring </br> 
                    for money or material goods, Castro failed to pay his bills;</br> 
                    his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing </br>
                    his wife.[42] He took part in a high school protest in Cienfuegos </br>
                    in November 1950, fighting with police to protest the Education Ministry's</br>
                     ban on student associations; he was arrested and charged for violent conduct, </br>
                     but the magistrate dismissed the charges.

            <div class="communism1">
                Cuba had a number of communist and anarchist organizations from the</br>
                 early period of the Republic (founded in 1902). The original</br>
                  "internationalised" Communist Party of Cuba formed in the 1920s.</br>
                   In 1944, it renamed itself as the Popular Socialist Party for electoral reasons.</br>
                    In July 1961, two years after the successful overthrow of Fulgencio Batista</br>
                     and the creation of a revolutionary government, the Integrated Revolutionary</br>
                      Organizations (ORI) was formed from the merger of:</br>
                           <ul>
                            <li> Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement  </li>
                            <li>The Popular Socialist Party led by Blas Roca</li>
                           <li> Parts of the student-based Revolutionary Directory led by Faure Chomón</li>
                           </ul>
                        </div>
            <p class="communism2">
                On 26 March 1962, the ORI became the United Party of the Cuban Socialist </br>
                Revolution (PURSC), which in turn became the Communist Party of Cuba on 3</br>
                 October 1965. In Article 5 of the Cuban constitution of 1976, the</br>
                  Communist Party is recognized as "the superior guiding force of society </br>
                  and of the State, that organizes and orients common efforts toward the high</br>
                   goals of the construction of socialism and the advancement toward communist</br>
                    society".[4][5] All parties, including the Communist Party, are prohibited</br>
                     from publicly advertising their organizations.
            </p>
            <div class="communism3">
                <h3>Central commitie</h3>
                The leading bodies of the party were the Politburo and the Secretariat </br>
                until 1991 when the two bodies were merged into an expanded Politburo </br>
                with over twenty members. However, the Secretariat was re-introduced</br> 
                in 2002. There is also a Central Committee which meets between party congresses.</br> 
                At the Fifth Congress, the size of the Central Committee was reduced to 150 members</br>
                 from the previous membership of 225. Fidel Castro was the party's First Secretary (or leader)</br>
                  since its inception while Raúl Castro was the Second Secretary. Upon Fidel Castro's 2008 </br>
                  resignation from the party and Cuban government, Raúl Castro became First Secretary.

                <h3>Forign relationship...</h3>
                The Communist Party of Cuba has often pursued an interventionist foreign  </br>
                policy, actively assisting left-wing revolutionary movements and governments  </br>
                abroad, including the ELN in Colombia, the FMLN in El Salvador, the Sandinistas  </br>
                in Nicaragua, and Maurice Bishop's New Jewel Movement in Grenada. </br>
            [citation needed] The party's most significant international role was </br>
             in the civil war in Angola, where Cuba directed a joint Angolan/Soviet/Cuban force  </br>
             in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale.[31][32] More recently, the party has sought to  </br>
             support Pink Tide leaders across Latin America, such as Hugo Chávez and later  </br>
             Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia. </br>
            </br>
             Medical diplomacy has also been a prominent feature of the Party's foreign policy. </br>
              The party maintains a policy of sending thousands of Cuban doctors, agricultural </br>
               technicians, and other professionals to other countries throughout the developing world.  </br>
               The party also supports Latin American integration.[33]
